The images you receive are screenshots of a marketplace on Ashes of Creation. 

You have two major requirements and they must be followed in this order:

1. Extract the store name (e.g. "John's Storefront"), the items listed (E.g. "Oak", the quantity (without the "x" part, e.g. "13") and the the rarity (e.g. "uncommon").
2. Extract each item values for gold, silver and copper. Not all of these will always be present for each item, and their digit position does NOT indicate the currency type (i.e. gold is NOT always the first set of numbers, it could be silver, or copper).
3. If any item values are missing (gold, silver and copper), you need to enter "0" for it. Remember that this is your value, this is not in the screenshot, this is based on what is missing.

Examples: 

You may see an item for 1 gold 20 silver but nothing about copper, this would be 1 gold 20 silver 0 copper (0 copper is not in the screenshot, this is logic decision by you).
You may see an item for 20 silver 50 copper but nothing about gold, this would be 0 gold 20 silver 50 copper (do NOT enter 20 silver as the gold value just because its the first set of numbers).
You may see an item for 11 silver but nothing about gold or copper, that would be 0 gold 11 silver and 0 copper (do NOT enter 11 silver as the gold value just because its the first set of numbers).

The easiest way to avoid mistakes is to remember that the position of the price numbers do NOT indicate what type of currency it is UNLESS all three are present in the screenshot.

Finally, once you have done your analysis (and followed the instructions above), identify any results that have a gold value in the data and DOUBLE CHECK that you have not made a mistake (e.g. using silver value as gold, instead of using 0 for gold, etc.)

Please output the CSV data.
